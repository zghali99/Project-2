# Project-2

Everytime someone wants to subsctibe to a entertainment account, specifically movies and shows; two major companies come to mind: Netflix and Hulu.

This Project will explore these two major market competitors. I will use two databses where each of them contains a list of movies and shows streamed in the United States by each of them, then I will show a list of movies and shows that both companies have as well as unique movies and shows that they each have that the other does not. 

Seeing such a list will help subsribers decide on which company to subsribe for.
